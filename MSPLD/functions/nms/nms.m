% Greedily select high-scoring detections and skip detections
% that are significantly covered by a previously selected
% detection.

% NOTE: This is adapted from Pedro Felzenszwalb's version (nms.m),
% but an inner loop has been eliminated to significantly speed it
% up in the case of a large number of boxes
