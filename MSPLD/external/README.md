## Information
In our ablative studies, we use the Non-overlapping ImageNet-Voc and Non-overlapping ImageNet-COCO to pre-train the classification models.
The Non-overlapping ImageNet-Voc is the ImageNet-1k data without the PASCAL VOC 20 classes, and the Non-overlapping ImageNet-COCO is similar to Non-overlapping ImageNet-VOC.
The `information` directory contains the classes in the Non-overlapping ImageNet-Voc and the Non-overlapping ImageNet-COCO.

See the list file : `ImageNet-1000.coco` and `ImageNet-1000.pvoc`. As these two lists are manually labeled by myself, there might be some mistakes.
